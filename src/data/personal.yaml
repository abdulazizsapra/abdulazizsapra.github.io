about:
  - >
    I'm a Full Stack Developer who turns business problems into working software.
    Over the past 5+ years, I've shipped 30+ projects across eCommerce, fintech,
    and enterprise web applications, consistently delivering on time and within
    scope. My work has directly contributed to measurable outcomes: websites that
    drove full bookings for months, eCommerce platforms processing $1M+ monthly,
    and fintech systems with zero security incidents.
  - >
    I specialise in React, Laravel, Shopify, and WordPress, but I'm pragmatic
    about technology. I pick the right tool for the job, not the trendiest one.
    I write code that other developers can understand and maintain, and I
    communicate clearly with both technical teams and business stakeholders.
  - >
    I hold a Master of ICT from Griffith University and have worked across
    agency environments, international remote teams, and direct client
    engagements. I'm now seeking a full-time permanent role where I can
    contribute to meaningful projects and grow within a strong engineering
    culture.
