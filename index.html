                        <p>Slow sites lose money. I optimise for Core Web Vitals, implement caching strategies, and
                            architect for scale from day one. 90+ Lighthouse scores are the baseline, not the goal.</p>

                            sanitisation, secure API design, and infrastructure hardening are built in, not bolted on.
